 1. empty group fails to load entire video
 2. msg shd start with Task prefix and as start of sentence : done
 3. whoze the admin/evaluator .. only his replies count towards points
 4. stat preview total against Tasks . not against name 
5. admin cannot post task completions.. 
6. If from same phone number 2 kids post tasks .. they should be counted against 2 separate profiles
7. Fix Applied: local patch
I have patched the 
node_modules/@whiskeysockets/baileys/lib/Utils/process-message.js
 file to safely handle these malformed parameters. Instead of crashing, the code will now catch the error and ignore the invalid data.

Specific changes:

File: 
node_modules/@whiskeysockets/baileys/lib/Utils/process-message.js
Change: Wrapped JSON.parse(message.messageStubParameters) calls in a try/catch block to prevent crashes from bad data.
